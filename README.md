This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project

## Getting Started

> Note that this project was compressed and sent without the node_modules to remove the bulky nature of the project and to encourage data low cost but it does not minimize the importance of node_modules which are definitely need for this project.

```bash
npm install --save

After installation, then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
node_modules and the .next files are set up

All codes are written in next.config.js

## Work Challenges

From my personal view, I do not think that the nextconfig constant is being reached after running build for both development and production... It may be due to the env object nested in the exported module.

Evaluate the code on next.config.js and make necessary corrections or add necessary steps you think will help in ensuring an optimized code.
